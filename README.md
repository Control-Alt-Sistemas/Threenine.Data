A simple lean & clean generic repository pattern for .net core  abstraction layer Entity Framework Core.


Originally inspired by writing my blog post  [Generic Repository Pattern .net core](https://garywoodfine.com/generic-repository-pattern-net-core/), however the project has moved on to develop a reusable unit of work package with dependency injection functionality.
